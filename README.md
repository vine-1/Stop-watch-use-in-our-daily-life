This web-based stopwatch features a sleek, modern design. It displays hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds within a circular frame. Styled with Poppins font, it has a black background and white text. Four buttons (Start, Stop, Reset, Share) control the stopwatch. JavaScript handles time increments, resets, and updates.
